/**
 * still a bit problematic
 *
 * need to check:
 * - if we can move to next step programmatically? - yes
 *   - !in our case, moving to next step can be triggered by a variety of events, such as clicking on a button, user drag over a node, ....
 *   - async tour might be useful in this case https://driverjs.com/docs/async-tour
 * - if the onboarding popover can disable clicking on outside of the popover? - yes
 *   - but for user drag and drop a node onto canvas, if we disable the clicking outside of the popover, the user can't drag and drop the node (only click on the node)
 * - can the element in step3, 5 be the same? - yes
 * 
 * challenges: depending on how we design the user onboarding flow
 *! - a challenge is that how to resume back to previous step if the state change has been made 
 *! - another challenge is that how to stop the tour steps (consecutive popover and popover overlays) in the middle and then resume back
