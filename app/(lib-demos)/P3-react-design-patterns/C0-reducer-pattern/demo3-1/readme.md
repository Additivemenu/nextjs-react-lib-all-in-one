In this code, I used a combination of several design patterns to handle the sequence execution:

1. **Command Pattern**:
- Each action in the sequence is essentially a command object that encapsulates all the information needed to perform an action later
- The `TodoAction` interface defines the structure of these commands:

```typescript
interface TodoAction {
  type: 'add';  // The command type
  payload: {     // The command data
    title: string;
    description: string;
  };
  delay?: number;     // Execution timing
  waitFor?: string;   // Dependencies
}
```

2. **Async Iterator Pattern**:
- The sequence executor processes actions one by one, asynchronously
- Uses `async/await` to handle timing and dependencies
- Here's a simplified version to show the pattern clearly:

```typescript
async function executeSequence() {
  for (const action of sequence) {
    // 1. Handle timing
    if (action.delay) {
      await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, action.delay));
    }

    // 2. Handle dependencies
    if (action.waitFor) {
      await checkDependency(action.waitFor);
    }

    // 3. Execute the action
    await executeAction(action);
  }
}
```

3. **State Machine Pattern**:
- The executor maintains state about the sequence execution:
  - `isRunning`: Whether a sequence is currently executing
  - `currentAction`: The current action being executed
  - `previousTodoId`: The ID of the last created todo (for dependencies)

Here's a more explicit example showing the state machine pattern:

```typescript
// Representing it as a state machine
interface ExecutorState {
  isRunning: boolean;
  currentActionIndex: number;
  previousTodoId: string | null;
  sequence: TodoAction[];
}

class SequenceExecutor {
  private state: ExecutorState = {
    isRunning: false,
    currentActionIndex: -1,
    previousTodoId: null,
    sequence: []
  };

  async executeNext() {
    if (!this.state.isRunning) return;
    
    const action = this.state.sequence[this.state.currentActionIndex];
    
    // Handle delays
    if (action.delay) {
      await this.handleDelay(action.delay);
    }
    
    // Handle dependencies
    if (action.waitFor === 'previous' && this.state.previousTodoId) {
      await this.handleDependency(this.state.previousTodoId);
    }
    
    // Execute action
    if (action.type === 'add') {
      this.state.previousTodoId = await this.executeAction(action);
    }
    
    // Move to next state
    this.state.currentActionIndex++;
    if (this.state.currentActionIndex >= this.state.sequence.length) {
      this.state.isRunning = false;
    }
  }
}
```

4. **Pub/Sub Pattern** (via Zustand):
- The todo store acts as a publisher of state changes
- Components subscribe to these changes and re-render accordingly

```typescript
const useTodoStore = create<TodoStore>((set) => ({
  todos: [],
  addTodo: (title, description) => {
    // Publish changes to subscribers
    set((state) => ({
      todos: [...state.todos, { /* new todo */ }]
    }));
  }
}));

// Subscribe to changes
const TodoList = () => {
  const todos = useTodoStore((state) => state.todos);
  // Re-renders when todos change
};
```

5. **Factory Pattern** (for creating todos):
- The `addTodo` function acts as a factory for creating new todos with consistent structure:

```typescript
addTodo: (title, description) => {
  const id = Date.now().toString();
  const newTodo = {
    id,
    title,
    description,
    completed: false,
  };
  set((state) => ({
    todos: [...state.todos, newTodo]
  }));
  return id;
}
```

To make this pattern more robust, you could:

1. Add a proper Queue implementation:
```typescript
class ActionQueue {
  private queue: TodoAction[] = [];
  
  enqueue(action: TodoAction) {
    this.queue.push(action);
  }
  
  dequeue(): TodoAction | undefined {
    return this.queue.shift();
  }
  
  peek(): TodoAction | undefined {
    return this.queue[0];
  }
}
```

2. Add error handling and retry logic:
```typescript
async executeAction(action: TodoAction, retries = 3): Promise<string> {
  try {
    return await this.addTodo(action.payload.title, action.payload.description);
  } catch (error) {
    if (retries > 0) {
      await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, 1000));
      return this.executeAction(action, retries - 1);
    }
    throw error;
  }
}
```

3. Add support for parallel execution of independent actions:
```typescript
async executeParallel(actions: TodoAction[]) {
  const independentActions = actions.filter(action => !action.waitFor);
  await Promise.all(independentActions.map(action => this.executeAction(action)));
}
```

The current implementation is relatively simple but could be extended based on these patterns to handle more complex scenarios like:
- Parallel execution of independent actions
- Rollback on failure
- More complex dependency graphs
- Different types of actions
- Action validation
- Progress tracking
- Error recovery

Would you like me to implement any of these extensions or explain any of the patterns in more detail?
