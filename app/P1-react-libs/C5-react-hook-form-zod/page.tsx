/**
 * use react-hook-form + zod:
 * - elegant form management & validation -> readable, maintainable, scalable code
 * - avoid unnecessary re-rendering as react-hook-form use ref
 *
 * 2 types of form -> representing 2 ways to define form:
 * - controlled form:
 *   - use the useForm hook to register inputs and manage their state by being wrapped into the Controller component.
 *   - they provide more granular control over the input state, allowing for easier integration with external  libraries and more complex validation logic.
 * - uncontrolled form:
 *   - inputs that are registered using the register function and have their state managed by the DOM.
 *   - Uncontrolled components can be simpler to implement, especially for basic forms, but can be more difficult to customize for more complex use cases.
 *
 * find more tutorials at https://react-hook-form.com/resources/articles
 *
 * ! many official examples (but many are in js, we will migrate those js example to ts): https://github.com/react-hook-form/react-hook-form/tree/master/examples
 *  - validation:
 *    - basic validation: https://codesandbox.io/s/react-hook-form-basic-validation-qdyye
 *    - custom validation -> register() config obj: https://codesandbox.io/p/sandbox/react-hook-form-custom-validation-8kuu7?file=%2Fsrc%2Findex.js%3A40%2C15
 *        - we can also use zod refine() for custom validation (see demo5 conditional fields)
 *    - ! compare field values-> getValues(): https://codesandbox.io/s/react-hook-form-getvalues-compare-field-values-orf0p
 *  - custom input:
 *    - use Controller component and `control` from useForm to integrate with custom input component
 *    - ! Controlled components: https://codesandbox.io/p/sandbox/react-hook-form-v7-controller-5h1q5?file=%2Fsrc%2FMui.js%3A35%2C18
